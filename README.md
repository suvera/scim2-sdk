# SCIM 2.0 Java SDK

System for Cross-domain Identity Management (**SCIM**) specification is designed to make managing 
user identities in cloud-based applications and services easier. The specification suite seeks to 
build upon experience with existing schemas and deployments, placing specific emphasis on 
simplicity of development and integration, while applying existing authentication, authorization, and 
privacy models. 

Its intent is to reduce the cost and complexity of user management operations by providing a common 
user schema and extension model, as well as binding documents to provide patterns for exchanging 
this schema using standard protocols. 
In essence: make it fast, cheap, and easy to move users in to, out of, and around the cloud.
